Concept
=======

A whack-a-mole style game with a Hallowe'en theme.  Night-time in a small patch
of pumpkins, the pumpkins are being possessed by evil spirits.  The player has
to tap the pumpkins only when they are possessed - tapping too late will allow
the spirit to escape.  The player has three lives, and loses a life whenever he
taps a pumpkin too early, or allows a spirit to escape.

A new life is granted every five levels, with no maximum.  Surviving a round
just leads to the next round, where difficulty increases in the form of faster
possession and less time before the spirit escapes.  There is no win-condition,
the player can only survive as long as they can.

Screen Layout
=============

Graphically, most of the scene is static with notable exceptions of the moon
(drifts left-to-right) an owl (moves eyes, occasionally blinks) and clouds
(drift slowly right-to-left).  Pumpkins shake slightly when being possessed and
more violently when the spirit is about to escape.

Some status information exists: all screens include the current best score (in
the form of rounds completed) in the top-left of the screen, the game screen
additionally includes a lives display in the top-centre, current round in the
top-right, and the time left in the current round towards the middle of the
screen.

Screens
=======

There are four different screens, namely:

* Main menu - provides access to the settings and help screens, also for
  starting the game.
* Help - a small number of help screens the player can flip through that
  describe how to play the game.
* Settings - a number of game options, including sound on/off, music on/off and
  resetting the top score.
* Game - the running game.

PumpkinScreen
=============

To reduce duplication, a Screen subclass exists to render the common elements of
each screen - the sky, hillside, trees, owl, clouds and moon.

Advertising
===========

The game is designed to be monetised via Google AdMob.  A single advert banner
should exist overlaid on the OpenGL canvas at top-middle of the screen.
Advertising will only appear on the menus, not during the game.
