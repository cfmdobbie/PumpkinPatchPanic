Concept
=======

A whack-a-mole style game with a Hallowe'en theme.  Night-time in a small patch
of pumpkins, the pumpkins are being possessed by evil spirits.  The player has
to tap the pumpkins only when they are possessed - tapping too early will
destroy the pumpkin and tapping too late will allow the spirit to escape.  The
player has three lives, and loses a life whenever a pumpkin is destroyed or a
spirit escapes.  A new life is granted every five(?) levels, to a maximum of
five.  Surviving a round just leads to the next round, where difficulty
increases in the form of faster possession and less time before the spirit
escapes.

Screen Layout
=============

Graphically, most of the scene is static with notable exceptions of the moon
(drifts left-to-right as the round progresses) an owl (occasionally ruffles
feathers, fidgets or blinks) and clouds (drift slowly right-to-left).  Pumpkins
shake slightly when being possessed and violently when the spirit is trying to
escape.

Some status information exists: most screens include the current best score (in
the form of levels/rounds completed) in the top-middle of the screen, the game
screen additionally includes a lives display in the top-left and the time left
in this round in the top-right.

Screens
=======

There are four different screens, namely:

* Main menu - provides access to the settings and help screens, also for
  starting the game.
* Help - a small number (4?) of help screens the player can flip through that
  describe how to play the game.
* Settings - a number of game options, including sound on/off, music on/off and
  resetting the top score.
* Game - the running game.

Data Model
==========

To reduce duplication, a structure should exist to render the common elements of
each screen - the sky, hillside, trees, owl, clouds and moon, although the moon
must be controllable from the screen as it has special significance in the game
screen.

Advertising
===========

The game is designed to be monetised via Google AdMob.  A single advert banner
should exist overlaid on the OpenGL canvas at bottom-middle of the screen.
Advertising will only appear on the main menu (not during game or on any other
menus.)
